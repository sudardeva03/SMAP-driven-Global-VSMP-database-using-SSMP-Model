The Vertical Soil Moisture Profile (VSMP) is a developed database consisting of soil moisture estimated at depths of 10 cm, 20 cm, 51 cm, and 102 cm beneath the surface. The estimates are derived using SMAP surface soil moisture data and a Statistical Soil Moisture Profile model that captures the spatial heterogeneity of the soil system.
